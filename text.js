    "hand": "A hand is the part of the body at the end of an arm. Most humans have two hands. Each hand usually has four fingers and a thumb. On the inside of the hand is the palm. When the fingers are all bent tightly, the hand forms a fist. The joints that are the hardest part of the fist are called knuckles. Many other animals, especially other primates, have hands that can hold things. Human hands can do things other hands cannot.",
    "human": "A human (also called a human being or person) is a member of the species Homo sapiens, which means 'wise man' in Latin.[1] Carolus Linnaeus put humans in the mammalian order of primates.[2] Humans are a type of hominoid, and chimpanzees are their closest living relatives.\n" +
    "Humans are social animals. They usually live in groups. They help and protect each other. They care for their children. Humans are bipedal, which means they walk on two legs. Humans have a very complex brain, which is much larger than that of the other living apes. They use language, make ideas, and feel emotions. This brain, and the fact that arms are not needed for walking, lets humans use tools. Humans use tools far more than any other species.\n" +
    "There are humans living on every continent.[3][4] As of 2017, there were over 7.3 billion people living on Earth.[5]",
    "foot": "A foot (one foot, two or more feet) is a body part on the end of a leg. We use it when walking, and it is important for balance: it helps us stand straight. We also use it to kick, in both fighting and sports, football being an example.\n" +
    "People's hands and feet have the same shape: they both have five digits (the fingers and toes). Many other animals with backbones also have five digits. The part of the foot which joins it to the leg is called the heel. The bottom of the foot is called the sole. Half the bones in our body are in the foot. Doctors who work with people's feet are podiatrists or chiropodists."
